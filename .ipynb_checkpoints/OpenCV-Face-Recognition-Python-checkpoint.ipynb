    "What is face recognition? Or what is recognition? When you look at an apple fruit, your mind immediately tells you that this is an apple fruit. This process, your mind telling you that this is an apple fruit is recognition in simple words. So what is face recognition then? We are sure you have guessed it right. When you look at your friend walking down the street or a picture of him, you recognize that he is your friend Ram. Interestingly when you look at your friend or a picture of him you look at his face first before looking at anything else. Ever wondered why you do that? This is so that you can recognize him by looking at his face. Well, this is you doing face recognition. \n",
    "\n",
    "But the real question is how does face recognition works? It is quite simple and intuitive. Take a real life example, when you meet someone first time in your life you don't recognize him, right? While he talks or shakes hands with you, you look at his face, eyes, nose, mouth, color and overall look. This is your mind learning or training for the face recognition of that person by gathering face data. Then he tells you that his name is Ram. At this point your mind knows that the face data it just learned belongs to Ram. Now your mind is trained and ready to do face recognition on Ram's face. Next time when you will see Ram or his face in a picture you will immediately recognize him. This is how face recognition work. The more you will meet Ram, the more data your mind will collect about Ram and especially his face and the better you will become at recognizing him. \n",
    "\n",
    "You might say that our mind can do these things easily but to actually code them into a computer is difficult? Don't worry, it is not. Thanks to OpenCV, coding face recognition is as easier as it feels. The coding steps for face recognition are same as we discussed it in real life example above.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training Data Gathering:** Gather face data (face images in this case) of the persons you want to recognize\n",
    "- **Training of Recognizer:** Feed that face data (and respective names of each face) to the face recognizer so that it can learn.\n",
    "- **Recognition:** Feed new faces of the persons and see if the face recognizer you just trained recognizes them.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenCV comes equipped with built in face recognizer, all you have to do is feed it the face data. It's that simple and this how it will look once we are done coding it.\n",

    "This algorithm considers the fact that not all parts of a face are equally important and equally useful. When you look at some one you recognize him/her by his distinct features like eyes, nose, cheeks, forehead and how they vary with respect to each other. So you are actually focusing on the areas of maximum change (mathematically speaking, this change is variance) of the face. For example, from eyes to nose there is a significant change and same is the case from nose to mouth. When you look at multiple faces you compare them by looking at these parts of the faces because these parts are the most useful and important components of a face. Important because they catch the maximum change among faces, change that helps you differentiate one face from the other. This is exactly how EigenFaces face recognizer works.  \n",
    "\n",
    "EigenFaces face recognizer looks at all the training images of all the persons as a whole and try to extract the components which are important and useful (the components that catch the maximum variance/change) and discards the rest of the components. This way it not only extracts the important components from the training data but also saves memory by discarding the less important components. These important components it extracts are called **principal components**. \n",

One thing to note in above image is that **Eigenfaces algorithm also considers illumination as an important component**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Later during recognition, when you feed a new image to the algorithm, it repeats the same process on that image as well. It extracts the principal component from that new image and compares that component with the list of components it stored during training and finds the component with the best match and returns the person label associated with that best match component.

    "This algorithm is an improved version of EigenFaces face recognizer. Eigenfaces face recognizer looks at all the training faces of all the persons at once and finds principal components from all of them combined. By capturing principal components from all of faces combined you are not focusing on the features that discriminate one person from the other but the features that represent all the faces of all the persons in the training data as a whole.\n",

EigenFaces face recognizer will consider those illumination changes very useful features and may discard the features of the other persons' faces considering them less useful. Now the features EigenFaces has extracted represent just one person's facial features and not all the persons' facial features. \n",

    "How to fix this? We can fix this by tunning EigenFaces face recognizer so that it extracts useful features from faces of each person separately instead of extracting useful features of all the faces combined.

    "Face Recognition is a fascinating idea to work on and OpenCV has made it extremely simple and easy for us to code it. It takes significant lines of code to have a fully working face recognition application and we can switch between all given face recognizers with a required lines of code change. \n",

    "Although EigenFaces, FisherFaces and LBPH face recognizers are good but there are even better ways to perform face recognition like using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOGs) and Neural Networks. So the more advanced face recognition algorithms are now a days implemented using a combination of OpenCV and Machine learning. We have plans to write some articles on those more advanced methods as well."
